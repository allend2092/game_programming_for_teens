;STRUCTURES
;The point type defines a single local coordinate position
Type point
	Field x,y
End Type 

;Create the three vertices of the triangle
point1.point = New point
point2.point = New point
point3.point = New point




;VARIABLES
;These variables define each vertex and are in local coordinates
point1\x= 0
point1\y= 0
point2\x= 100
point2\y= 100
point3\x= -100
point3\y = 100

;CONSTANTS
;The global indicators that is added to each local coordinate to place it on screen
Const xs = 512
Const ys = 284


;MAIN SECTION
;Make sure text appears at bottom of screen

;Multiply all the coordinates by the scaling factor
